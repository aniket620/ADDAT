# ADDAT
The number of accidents in the United States due to driving under the influence of alcohol is on the rise each year. Almost every hour, one person dies due to drunk driving crashes and a total of $44 billion in damages. Alcohol is a substance that significantly reduces the driver's function in terms of thinking, reasoning, and reaction time to an event. This paper explores the possibility of using Internet of Things (IoT) technology in the design of an Anti-drink and Anti-Theft Mechanism (ADAAT) to detect the level of alcohol in the blood of the driver before it allows the driver to operate the vehicle. The ADAAT device prevents drunk drivers by locking the steering wheel when the blood alcohol content exceeds 0.08%. Furthermore, the ADAAT device immediately notifies via phone application to choose either to call/text the emergency contacts set previously by the driver or book an Uber.
The model created uses an Arduino UNO R3 and MQ-3 alcohol sensor to detect the blood alcohol content. The ADAAT device is attached to a steering wheel lock and when the MQ-3 alcohol sensor detects that the driver is sober, the system unlocks. The presented design can be produced as a product for every vehicle which can help to save the life of a drunk driver and other drivers on the road.
